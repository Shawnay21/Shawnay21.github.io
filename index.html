                    Welcome to my corner of the web! ðŸ‘‹ As a passionate and dedicated individual aspiring to make a mark in the dynamic field of cybersecurity, I am thrilled to share my journey with you. With a keen interest in securing digital landscapes and ensuring online safety, I have actively pursued opportunities to enhance my skills and knowledge.

As a current student on the path to obtaining my bachelor's degree, I've successfully completed a rigorous cybersecurity bootcamp, equipping myself with practical skills through hands-on projects. These experiences have not only expanded my technical capabilities but also fueled my enthusiasm for the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity.

March holds a pivotal moment for me as I prepare to sit for the Security+ certification, a testament to my commitment to staying ahead in this fast-paced industry. Beyond my professional aspirations, I am a proud single mother to a vibrant 3-year-old boy. Balancing the demands of cybersecurity education with the joys of motherhood, I've learned to efficiently manage my time and priorities.

Join me on this journey, where dedication, resilience, and a passion for cybersecurity converge with the joys of motherhood. Together, let's explore the fascinating world of digital defense and the unwavering spirit that propels me forward in both my professional and personal life.<br>
